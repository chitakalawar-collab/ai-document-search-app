Features

PDF Parsing: Extracts text from PDF files accurately.

Question-Answering: Provides answers to user queries based on document content.

Semantic Search: Understands context and retrieves relevant information.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive system for ease of use.

Tools & Technologies

Python

NLP Libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or Transformers)

PDF Processing Libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber)

Machine Learning / AI models for question answering

How to Use

Upload a PDF document to the system.

Enter your query in the input field.

The system processes the document and provides a precise answer.
